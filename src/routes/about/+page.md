# Who is this blog for?

Anyone! I intentionally try to make the content of each entry accessible to a wide variety of audiences. Whether you just heard your senior engineer co-worker reference a term you've never heard and were too afraid to ask for clarification or whether you're a seasoned engineer who needs a refresher on a topic, this blog is for you. 

# Why ELIH?

> Tl;dr: There's a vast world of software engineering concepts and there's a vast world or resources to learn about those concepts. I've found many resources to be either hyper-specific or hyper-generic. With this blog, my goal is to attempt to extract useful tidbits from documentation, break down complex concepts, and consolidate the vast world of technical knowledge into approachable, digestible morsels.

** Backstory: ** You can read more about me, the author, here, but suffice it to say, I've always felt like an imposter in the software engineering world. I didn't grow up writing code or even playing video games. I spend my free time outdoors and don't believe that humans should look at computer screens for 8+ hours a day. Thinking like a computer does NOT come naturally to me, especially on days when my right brain is feeling particularly active or my ADHD flares up. And yet, for some reason, I chose to be a software engineer because some days, I really enjoy it. 

And then there are the days like my first day on my first team as a front end engineer where I heard the term "server-side rendering" multiple times and felt like a complete imposter because I didn't know what it meant. And even after a quick side-Google (that's my term for whenever I have to sneakily look something up during a meeting or pair programming session), I still couldn't quickly conceptualize or contextualize how it fit into other aspects of web development. So while this blog hopefully helps you, each post was created out of necessity for my own learning.
